                            Discord isnâ€™t a social media platform. There is no algorithm deciding what you should see, no endless scrolling, no news feed, no counting likes, no going viral. Instead, Discord is a place where everyone can be themselves and spend time with other people who share their interests and hobbies. Conversations on Discord are driven only by the people you choose and the topics you pick.</p>
